    <h1>Making Something Great</h1>
    <h3>Why is visualization effective?</h3>
    <p>According to Cairo, the human brain is effective at mentally visualizing
    numbers that are well rounded. We have an instictive idea about 72 versus
    100. However, the human brain is not as effective at picturing other forms
    of numbers without aid. Visual aides help the human brain envision data in
    a way that cannot be done alone.</p>
    <h3>What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks.</h3>
    <p>In the 1980s, the statisticians William S. Cleveland and Robert McGill
    created what they called a hierarchy of elementary perceptual tasks. In
    The graphics considered more effective (line and bar charts with positioning
    along common scales) are in the higher levels while graphics in the lower
    levels (area and color graphs that are not as precise) are considered more
    general. It is ideal that readers will be able to make fast and accurate
    estimates with your graphic and graphs with positioning along common scales
    allow for more precise estimations.</p>
    <h3>What are trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization?</h3>
    <p>While graphics in the higher levels of the hierarchy are ideal for precise
    data visualization, sometimes the goal is to reveal a more general data trend.
    Data maps can be very useful in determining geographical trends.</p>
